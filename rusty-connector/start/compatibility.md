# 🔥 Compatibility
While RustyConnector is a very versatile plugin, 

## 🕹️ MC Loaders
Currently, RustyConnector is only available on **paper**. Using any fork of paper is possible (like Purpur, airplane...) but not officially supported.

## 🛩️ Proxy
We only support **Velocity**. Waterfall is deprecated and Bungeecord not asked enough.
