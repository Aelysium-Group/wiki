# 🔥 Compatibility
While RustyConnector is a very versatile plugin, 

## 🕹️ MC Loaders
Currently, RustyConnector is available on **paper**, **folia**, and **fabric**. Using any fork of paper is possible (like Purpur, airplane...) but not officially supported.

## 🛩️ Proxy
We only support **Velocity**. Waterfall is a deprecated platform and Bungeecord is also outdated.
