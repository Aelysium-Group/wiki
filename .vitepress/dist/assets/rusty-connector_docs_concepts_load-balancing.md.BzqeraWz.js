For a full breakdown of what all the data means you can read <a href="#reading-the-load-balancer-in-the-console">this snippet</a>.</p></div><p>In the example above, we have four servers registered to a family with a Least Connection Algorithm. One of the servers has its own whitelist allowing only VIP players to join it. Additionally, all servers have a soft-cap of <code>40</code> and a hard-cap of <code>50</code>. Servers 2 and 3 are both maxed out for regular players.</p><p>If a player were to attempt to join this family here&#39;s a step by step of what would happen:</p><ol><li>Player attempts to connect to <code>VIP-whitelist</code> connection fails. Persistence kicks in. One attempt has been used. Persistence cause&#39;s the player&#39;s connection to now operate via Round Robin algorithm (this way it will always attempt to connect to a different server until its attempts are used up)</li><li>Player attempts to connect to PrimaryLoader1. Connection fails. Second attempt has been used.</li><li>Player attempts to connect to PrimaryLoader2. Connection fails. Third attempt has been used.</li><li>Player attempts to connect to BackupLoader1. Connection succeeds. Persistence shut&#39;s off.</li><li>Family insertion point returns to original position.</li></ol><p>The whole operation happens in a split second and will go unnoticed by your end-users. This system is particularly useful for music events when you want to have VIP, such as artists and sponsors, auto-route to a VIP server. You can weight the VIP server to be at the top of the family queue and enable persistence. Any players that join the family will automatically bounce over the VIP server and fall into one of the public servers.</p><p>If a player runs out of persistence attempts before they can be connected to a server; their attempt to connect to the specific family will fail.</p><h2 id="reading-the-load-balancer-in-the-console" tabindex="-1">Reading the load balancer in the console <a class="header-anchor" href="#reading-the-load-balancer-in-the-console" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Reading the load balancer in the console&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The messages in the load balancer console can be cryptic.
