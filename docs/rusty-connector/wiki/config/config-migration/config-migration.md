RustyConnector configs may change over time.
Use the following documents to consolidate changes between the config versions.

## Config Plugin Versions
View which plugin versions correspond with which config versions.
You can click on any of the upgrade buttons to see the docs on how to update your config to a specific version.

We do not provide "leap upgrade" documentation. If you wish to upgrade between multiple config versions (for example: from v1 to v4.) You will need to step up the ladder until you are at the desired configuration version.

If you don't want to worry about trying to update your configs. You can simply delete all your config files and RustyConnector will generate new files in the version that it needs. From there you can re-configure RustyConnector to your needs.
