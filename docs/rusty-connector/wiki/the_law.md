So you've become a RustyConnector Network? Congratulations!
But with great power comes great responsibility! If you don't follow these guidelines, you'll regret it!

RustyConnector isn't just some plugin, it's your network backbone. We make the rules and people have to follow them.

## 1. Respect The Great Families
In traditional Minecraft management, you know each server individually by name and you would send players to a specific server.
When working in an RC Network; you should be thinking in terms of families instead of individual servers.
You aren't sending players to a specific hub server anymore. Instead, you send those players to the `hub` family and THAT family will decide what server it routes players to.

## 2. No Direct Connections
RustyConnector heavily rewrites tons of default behavior pertaining to player connections.
Any plugins which deal with player connections are bound to break things unless they specifically implement RustyConnector's API.

If you have a plugin that you wanna use but it doesn't work with your RustyConnector Network, feel free to send the developer our way. We'd love to chat with them about bringing RC support to their plugin!
