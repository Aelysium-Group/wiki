title: ðŸŒŠ Liquid Timestamp
---
While working with RustyConnector configurations. You may encounter a liquid timestamp.
These data types allow you to define a string value which will be translated into a unit of time.

## Syntax
Liquid Timestamps use the following syntax:

`<amount><unit>` || `<amount> <unit>`

`amount` should be the number of units that you want to set.
`unit` should be the [time unit](#supported-time-units) that you want to use.

## Supported Time Units

| Name     | ID Key | Description                                                                 |
| -----    | -----  | -----                                                                       |
| `Second` | `s`    | Unit of time representing a second. The plural "Seconds" is also supported. |
| `Minute` | `m`    | Unit of time representing a minute. The plural "Minutes" is also supported. |
| `Hour`   | `h`    | Unit of time representing a n hour. The plural "Hours" is also supported.   |
| `Day`    | `d`    | Unit of time representing a day. The plural "Days" is also supported.       |

All time units are case insensitive.

The time formats don't care if you:
- Use shorthand versions ("d" instead of "day")
- Use plurals ("Day" versus "Days")
- Use caps ("day" versus "DAY")
- Use whitespaces ("1d" versus "1 d")
